--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot/

    -I also followed a tutorial by The Net Ninja on youtube
        I watched up to video 8, this is a link to the playlist:

    -For the navbar icons, I used Google Materials icons for a rounded home icon, rounded code icon, and a rounded question icon

    -For other icons, I used primarily Flaticon and Wikipedia, many of them belong to a user name FreePik, 
    and I have hyperlinked the icons and/or credited them to their respective websites.

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    Did not discuss with other individuals on this assignment. I worked on this project entirely by myself with the help of online resources (as noted above).


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    The validation check for CSS does not pass but this has to due with BootStrap, and not my CSS file. 
    The html and achecker validations pass. Also, I'm not sure if my form works correctly. I set "action=mailto:" and
    I haven't gotten any of the test emails I have sent. However, it is too late to fix it before the deadline.
